This game is like dino run but has Mario, Luigi, pipes and more! The controls are Space to start, restart and jump! The down arrow is to duck as long as you hold it. L and M are to choose a sacrifice for when you die. The objective is to dodge as many obstacles as you can and get the highest score.
